# Constraint-Based-Modelling Repository

General Description
This repository contains essential resources and code for Constraint-Based Modelling (CBM), an approach used to simulate metabolic networks. CBM is particularly utilized here to study and compare metabolic states in myeloma and healthy tissue, with the aim of identifying genes that can effectively target myeloma cell lines.

Repository Contents
Models: This directory contains six CBM model files, including three models of myeloma and three models of healthy tissue, which can be used to run simulations and analyze metabolic differences.
Report: A detailed document presenting the outcomes of the simulations, statistical analysis, and visualizations of the data. The report focuses on comparing the six models to pinpoint effective genes for targeting myeloma.
Source Code: Python scripts that include the implementations used to generate the models, run simulations, and process the output data.
